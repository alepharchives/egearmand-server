=== introduction

An experimental Gearmand distributed server written in Erlang with all the things Gearman should not have: replicated persistent queues,
incipient error recovery and support for clustering.

=== dependencies

Erlang (tested with OTP R13B01),
Ruby and Rake for compiling
erlang-rfc4627 (included in the contrib directory)

=== extensions

From version 0.3 the server has initial support for extensions.
An extension connecting the Gearman server implementation to the
RabbitMQ queue system is included. To use the extension, be sure
you have erlang-rfc4627 in the path and before calling to
gearmand:start(), invoke rabbitmq_extension:start() from the
erlang shell.
There are examples in the /examples direcytory  of three ruby
scripts creating, publishing and consuming messages from a queue
through the egearmand server.

=== tests

Few and scattered through the source files.

=== configuration

By now in file src/configuration.erl. Take a look at the comments.
Must be edited before compiling.
If you want to use persistent queues, you must create the replicated Mnesia schema before calling to gearmand:start().
You can use mnesia_store:create_tables(), after initiating calling to mnesia:create_schema(configuration:gearmand_nodes()).

=== compile

$rake

=== running

$erl -pa ebin -pa contrib
>rabbitmq_extension:start()               %% optional, if you want to try the rabbitmq extension
>gearmand:start("localhost",4730) .
