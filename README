=== introduction

An experimental Gearmand distributed server written in Erlang with all the things Gearman should not have: replicated persistent queues,
incipient error recovery and support for clustering.

=== dependencies

Erlang (tested with OTP R13B01),
Ruby and Rake for compiling

=== tests

Few and scattered throug the source files.

=== configuration

By now in file src/configuration.erl. Take a look at the comments.
Must be edited before compiling.
If you want to use persistent queues, you must create the replicated Mnesia schema before calling to gearmand:start(). 
You can use mensia_store:create_tables(), after initiating calling to mensia:create_schema(configuration:gearmand_nodes()).

=== compile

$rake

=== running

$erl -pa ebin
>gearmand:start("localhost",4730) .
